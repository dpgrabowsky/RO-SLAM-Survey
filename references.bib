Moreover, signal metrics of this network are used to provide an embedded Range Only localization scheme (RO-SLAM). When working with teams of robots, the communication between them is very important as it allows them to cooperate for the performing of the tasks. Additionally, being able to localize each other can allow the robots to optimize tasks and work more efficiently. Having both communication and localization integrated on-board in an small device is advantageous for micro-aerial systems in which payload is highly limited.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of range-based autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) localization in the presence of unknown ocean currents. In the setup adopted, the AUV is equipped with an attitude and heading reference system, a depth sensor, and an acoustic device that provides measurements of its distance to a set of stationary beacons. We consider the situation where the number of active beacons is not known in advance and may vary with time. The objective is to simultaneously localize the AUV and beacons, that is, to find their positions underwater. We start by deriving conditions under which it is possible to reconstruct the initial condition of the system under study. We consider the design model where the states evolve continuously with time, but the range measurements are only available at discrete instants of time, possibly in a nonuniform manner. For trimming maneuvers that correspond to AUV trajectories with constant linear and angular velocities expressed in the body frame, we show that if either the position of one of the beacons or the initial position of the AUV is known, then even without depth information the system is weakly observable (i.e., the set of states that are indistinguishable from a given initial configuration contains only a set of finite isolated points). If depth measurements are also available, then the system is observable even in the presence of unknown constant ocean currents. Equipped with these results, we then propose a novel observer for simultaneous AUV and beacon localization. The mathematical setup exploited borrows from minimum-energy estimation theory applied to continuous-time processes with discrete measurements, projection filters, and multiple-model estimation techniques. Convergence analysis of the resulting observer system yields conditions under which the estimation errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin (whose size depends on the magnitude of the process and measurement noise). The results of fie- d experiments with a robotic marine vehicle show the efficacy of the simultaneous AUV/multiple beacon localization system proposed.},

abstract = {The Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm is a flexible method to generate samples from a target distribution, a key problem in probabilistic inference. In this paper we propose a variation of the MH algorithm based on group moves, where the next state is obtained by first choosing a random transformation of the state space and then applying this transformation to the current state. This adds much-needed flexibility to the "textbook" MH algorithm where all measures involved must be given in terms of densities with respect to a common reference measure. Under mild conditions, our main result extends the acceptance probability formula of the textbook algorithm to MH algorithms with group moves. We work out how the new algorithms can be used to exploit a problem's natural symmetries and apply the technique to the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem, obtaining the first fully rigorous justification of a previous MCMC-based SLAM method. New experimental results comparing our method to existing state-of-the-art specialized methods on a standard range-only SLAM benchmark problem validate the strength of the approach.},

abstract = {Range-only SLAM (RO-SLAM) represents a difficult problem due to the inherent ambiguity of localizing either the robot or the beacons from distance measurements only. Most previous approaches to this problem employ non-probabilistic batch optimizations or delay the initialization of new beacons within a probabilistic filter until a good estimate is available. The contribution of this work is the formulation of RO-SLAM as an online Bayesian estimation process based on a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter. The conditional distribution for each beacon is initialized using an additional particle filter which, eventually, is transformed into an extended Kalman filter when the uncertainty becomes sufficiently small. This approach allows the introduction of new beacons without either delay or any special non-probabilistic processing. We validate our proposal with experiments for both simulated and real datasets.},

Herein we present an EKF-SLAM algorithm which allows using radio frequency (RF) beacons without any prior knowledge of their location. As RF beacons provide only range information, recovering their positions is not an easy task. For this range-only SLAM case, a new procedure to instantiate the beacons in the filter is proposed. The method uses two range measurements from different robot's positions to initialize two hypotheses for the beacon's location, which are then integrated in the filter as a Gaussian mixture. This approach is evaluated and compared to other initialization techniques in simulation and with a real dataset. The results show that our approach performs as well as the other existing methods for both trajectory and map errors with a low computational cost.},

Recent advances in radio frequency technology make it possible to measure range between inexpensive beacons and a transponder Such a method has tremendous benefit since line of sight is not required between the beacons and the transponder and because the data association problem can be completely avoided. If the positions of the beacons are known, measurements from multiple beacons can be combined using probability grids to provide an accurate estimate of robot location. This estimate can be improved by using Monte Carlo techniques and Kalman filters to incorporate odometry data. Similar methods can be used to solve the simultaneous localization and mapping problem (SLAM) when beacon locations are uncertain. Experimental results are presented for robot localization. Tracking and SLAM algorithms are demonstrated in simulation.},

abstract = {This paper presents the localization of a mobile robot while simultaneously mapping the position of the nodes of a Wireless Sensor Network using only range measurements. The robot can estimate the distance to nearby nodes of the Wireless Sensor Network by measuring the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of the received radio messages. The RSSI measure is very noisy, especially in an indoor environment due to interference and reflections of the radio signals. We adopted an Extended Kalman Filter SLAM algorithm to integrate RSSI measurements from the different nodes over time, while the robot moves in the environment. A simple pre-processing filter helps in reducing the RSSI variations due to interference and reflections. Successful experiments are reported in which an average localization error less than 1 m is obtained when the SLAM algorithm has no a priori knowledge on the wireless node positions, while a localization error less than 0.5 m can be achieved when the position of the node is initialized close to the their actual position. These results are obtained using a generic path loss model for the transmission channel. Moreover, no internode communication is necessary in the WSN. This can save energy and enables to apply the proposed system also to fully disconnected networks.},

In this paper we propose a novel technique for solving the WiFi SLAM problem using the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GP-LVM) to determine the latent-space locations of unlabeled signal strength data. We show how GP-LVM, in combination with an appropriate motion dynamics model, can be used to reconstruct a topological connectivity graph from a signal strength sequence which, in combination with the learned Gaussian Process signal strength model, can be used to perform efficient localization.},

Most existing RO-SLAM techniques consider beacons as passive devices disregarding the sensing, computational and communication capabilities with which they are actually endowed. SLAM is a resource-demanding task. Besides the technological constraints of the robot and beacons, many applications impose further resource consumption limitations. This paper presents a scalable distributed RO-SLAM scheme for resource-constrained operation. It is capable of exploiting robot-beacon cooperation in order to improve SLAM accuracy while meeting a given resource consumption bound expressed as the maximum number of measurements that are integrated in SLAM per iteration. The proposed scheme combines a Sparse Extended Information Filter (SEIF) SLAM method, in which each beacon gathers and integrates robot-beacon and inter-beacon measurements, and a distributed information-driven measurement allocation tool that dynamically selects the measurements that are integrated in SLAM, balancing uncertainty improvement and resource consumption. The scheme adopts a robot-beacon distributed approach in which each beacon participates in the selection, gathering and integration in SLAM of robot-beacon and inter-beacon measurements, resulting in significant estimation accuracies, resource-consumption efficiency and scalability. It has been integrated in an octorotor Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) and evaluated in 3D SLAM outdoor experiments.

abstract = {This paper presents a Range Only (RO) Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) scheme that integrates multi-hop inter-beacon range measurements. While few SLAM schemes use inter-beacon measurements, to the best of our knowledge, none of them integrates multi-hop inter-beacon measurements. In our scheme the robot gathers inter-beacon measurements with config-urable hop number so that it can integrate measurements between beacons far beyond the robot's sensing range. This paper analyzes the impact of integrating in SLAM inter-beacon measurements with different hop numbers and evaluates its performance and ro-bustness to measurement and odometry noise levels. It shows that the advantages of using inter-beacon measurements increase with measurements with higher hop numbers. {\textcopyright} 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {— A mobile robot we have developed is equipped with sensors to measure range to landmarks and can simultaneously localize itself as well as locate the landmarks. This modality is useful in those cases where environmental conditions preclude measurement of bearing (typically done optically) to landmarks. Here we extend the paradigm to consider the case where the landmarks (nodes of a sensor network) are able to measure range to each other. We show how the two capabilities are complimentary in being able to achieve a map of the landmarks and to provide localization for the moving robot. We present recent results with experiments on a robot operating in a randomly arranged network of nodes that can communicate via radio and range to each other using sonar. We find that incorporation of inter-node measurements helps reduce drift in positioning as well as leads to faster convergence of the map of the nodes. We find that addition of a mobile node makes the SLAM feasible in a sparsely connected network of nodes.},

abstract = {Use of a Gaussian Sum filter (GSF) to efficiently solve the initialisation problem in bearing-only simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) is the main contribution of this paper. When information about the range is not available, the initial probability density function (pdf) of a landmark in the environment can not be represented using a Gaussian. The GSF is an attractive candidate for estimation in this scenario as it can deal with arbitrary pdfs represented as sets of Gaussians. However, the implementation of the GSF requires maintaining a bank of extended Kalman filters. The resulting computational complexity needs to be reduced by employing a minimum number of filters. In this work, the performance of each extended Kalman filter (EKF) in the GSF is evaluated using the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). As such the number of members in the Gaussian sum can be reduced rapidly and the efficiency of the GSF can be significantly increased, providing a solution to the important problem of bearing-only SLAM. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by simulation and experiment conducted using a Pioneer mobile robot.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. Range-only sensors, in contrast to bearing-only sensors or LIDAR sensors are sensors which only provides distance between two points but not bearing information. The reduced amount of information provided by this sensors makes their application in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problems specially challenging due to the lack of information. The complexity of the problem becomes higher when using noisy range-only sensors like radio-based where the multi-path effect may introduce range outliers, hence reducing the precision of the SLAM solution. Furthermore, the application of Range-only SLAM to aerial systems implies a higher level of complexity due to the introduction to a 3th dimensionality in contrast to ground mobile robots where the altitude dimension is not necessary in most applications. This paper presents an efficient and robust method to the Range-only SLAM (RO-SLAM) problem when applied to aerial vehicles and radio-based range-only measurements. The method is based on a pre-filtering algorithm which is able to detect and remove range outliers and on the application of a reduced parameterization which scales better with 3D RO-SLAM problems. The method is validated with real experiments involving an aerial vehicle and multiple radio-based range-only sensors.},

Moreover, it does not scale computationally to large sets of data, requiring O (N3) operations per iteration. We present a GraphSLAM-like algorithm for signal strength SLAM. Our algorithm shares many of the benefits of Gaussian processes, yet is viable for a broader range of environments since it makes no signature uniqueness assumptions.

It simultaneously estimates the beacon (a priori unknown) and AUV (a priori known) positions. Conventional EKF-SLAM methods cannot deal with this problem since the resultant probability density function (pdf) of the beacon-position is severely non-Gaussian during the initialization. Particle filters can do the job but, depending on the size of the space where the beacon lays, a significant number of particles may be required to populate the solution domain, making difficult to achieve real-time performance. In this paper we present a filter which represents the joint pdf of the robot and beacon positions as a Multivariate Gaussian Mixture which has the potential to represent an arbitrary pdf with a number of Gaussian 'particles' significantly smaller than the one that would be necessary if conventional particles were used instead. In our method, each particle contains a full EKF over vehicle position/velocity and the beacon position. The method is applied to locate a sub-sea panel and home to it autonomously in order to establish visual contact to later launch a visual servoing based docking task.

abstract = {We present a novel spectral learning algorithm for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from range data with known correspondences. This algorithm is an instance of a general spectral system identification framework, from which it inherits several desirable properties, including statistical consistency and no local optima. Compared with popular batch optimization or multiple-hypothesis tracking (MHT) methods for range-only SLAM, our spectral approach offers guaranteed low computational requirements and good tracking performance. Compared with popular extended Kalman filter (EKF) or extended information filter (EIF) approaches, and many MHT ones, our approach does not need to linearize a transition or measurement model; such linearizations can cause severe errors in EKFs and EIFs, and to a lesser extent MHT, particularly for the highly non-Gaussian posteriors encountered in range-only SLAM. We provide a theoretical analysis of our method, including finite-sample error bounds. Finally, we demonstrate on a real-world robotic SLAM problem that our algorithm is not only theoretically justified, but works well in practice: in a comparison of multiple methods, the lowest errors come from a combination of our algorithm with batch optimization, but our method alone produces nearly as good a result at far lower computational cost.},
