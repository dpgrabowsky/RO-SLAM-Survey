abstract = {Range-only SLAM (RO-SLAM) represents a difficult problem due to the inherent ambiguity of localizing either the robot or the beacons from distance measurements only. Most previous approaches to this problem employ non-probabilistic batch optimizations or delay the initialization of new beacons within a probabilistic filter until a good estimate is available. The contribution of this work is the formulation of RO-SLAM as an online Bayesian estimation process based on a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter. The conditional distribution for each beacon is initialized using an additional particle filter which, eventually, is transformed into an extended Kalman filter when the uncertainty becomes sufficiently small. This approach allows the introduction of new beacons without either delay or any special non-probabilistic processing. We validate our proposal with experiments for both simulated and real datasets.},

It uses Gaussian Mixtures for undelayed initialization of the position of the wireless nodes. The paper shows how the approach can be integrated within a Kalman Filter. This way, information can be used in the filter since the first measurement.

When information about the range is not available, the initial probability density function (pdf) of a landmark in the environment can not be represented using a Gaussian. The GSF is an attractive candidate for estimation in this scenario as it can deal with arbitrary pdfs represented as sets of Gaussians. However, the implementation of the GSF requires maintaining a bank of extended Kalman filters. The resulting computational complexity needs to be reduced by employing a minimum number of filters. In this work, the performance of each extended Kalman filter (EKF) in the GSF is evaluated using the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). As such the number of members in the Gaussian sum can be reduced rapidly and the efficiency of the GSF can be significantly increased, providing a solution to the important problem of bearing-only SLAM. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by simulation and experiment conducted using a Pioneer mobile robot.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of range-based autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) localization in the presence of unknown ocean currents. In the setup adopted, the AUV is equipped with an attitude and heading reference system, a depth sensor, and an acoustic device that provides measurements of its distance to a set of stationary beacons. We consider the situation where the number of active beacons is not known in advance and may vary with time. The objective is to simultaneously localize the AUV and beacons, that is, to find their positions underwater. We start by deriving conditions under which it is possible to reconstruct the initial condition of the system under study. We consider the design model where the states evolve continuously with time, but the range measurements are only available at discrete instants of time, possibly in a nonuniform manner. For trimming maneuvers that correspond to AUV trajectories with constant linear and angular velocities expressed in the body frame, we show that if either the position of one of the beacons or the initial position of the AUV is known, then even without depth information the system is weakly observable (i.e., the set of states that are indistinguishable from a given initial configuration contains only a set of finite isolated points). If depth measurements are also available, then the system is observable even in the presence of unknown constant ocean currents. Equipped with these results, we then propose a novel observer for simultaneous AUV and beacon localization. The mathematical setup exploited borrows from minimum-energy estimation theory applied to continuous-time processes with discrete measurements, projection filters, and multiple-model estimation techniques. Convergence analysis of the resulting observer system yields conditions under which the estimation errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin (whose size depends on the magnitude of the process and measurement noise). The results of fie- d experiments with a robotic marine vehicle show the efficacy of the simultaneous AUV/multiple beacon localization system proposed.},

abstract = {Underwater sensor networks (USN) are used for harsh oceanographic missions where human operation is dangerous or impossible. Localization is essential for USNs. It is required for data tagging, node tracking and position-based routing algorithms. Localization is challenging because Global Positioning System(GPS) is not available in underwater; at the same time, existing GPS-less schemes based on fixed landmarks have high communication cost. Such cost is critical in mobile underwater sensor networks (MUSN), since sensor nodes drift with the ocean currents, thus requiring continuous refresh. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage localization scheme using mobile beacons. The beacons periodically ascent and descent in the water column. When they resurface, they receive new GPS coordinates. Then, they dive to the level of the underwater sensors to advertise these coordinates. In turn, localized sensors become proxy beacons and propagate their own coordinates, etc. This iterative, multi-stage localization is the major innovation of this paper. The goal is to localize the nodes with the smallest number of beacons using proxies instead, yet achieving an adequate accuracy. The major benefit is the reduction in operating costs. Mobility is a critical factor in determining performance. In this paper, performance (i.e., the percentage of localized nodes during a cycle, accuracy, delay and communication cost) is tested in a simulation scenario based on a realistic mobility model. The "meandering current mobility with surface effect" (MCM-SE) model - a composite model combining surface and subsurface currents.},

Moreover, it does not scale computationally to large sets of data, requiring O (N3) operations per iteration. We present a GraphSLAM-like algorithm for signal strength SLAM. Our algorithm shares many of the benefits of Gaussian processes, yet is viable for a broader range of environments since it makes no signature uniqueness assumptions.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. Range-only sensors, in contrast to bearing-only sensors or LIDAR sensors are sensors which only provides distance between two points but not bearing information. The reduced amount of information provided by this sensors makes their application in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problems specially challenging due to the lack of information. The complexity of the problem becomes higher when using noisy range-only sensors like radio-based where the multi-path effect may introduce range outliers, hence reducing the precision of the SLAM solution. Furthermore, the application of Range-only SLAM to aerial systems implies a higher level of complexity due to the introduction to a 3th dimensionality in contrast to ground mobile robots where the altitude dimension is not necessary in most applications. This paper presents an efficient and robust method to the Range-only SLAM (RO-SLAM) problem when applied to aerial vehicles and radio-based range-only measurements. The method is based on a pre-filtering algorithm which is able to detect and remove range outliers and on the application of a reduced parameterization which scales better with 3D RO-SLAM problems. The method is validated with real experiments involving an aerial vehicle and multiple radio-based range-only sensors.},

This algorithm is an instance of a general spectral system identification framework, from which it inherits several desirable properties, including statistical consistency and no local optima. Compared with popular batch optimization or multiple-hypothesis tracking (MHT) methods for range-only SLAM, our spectral approach offers guaranteed low computational requirements and good tracking performance. Compared with popular extended Kalman filter (EKF) or extended information filter (EIF) approaches, and many MHT ones, our approach does not need to linearize a transition or measurement model; such linearizations can cause severe errors in EKFs and EIFs, and to a lesser extent MHT, particularly for the highly non-Gaussian posteriors encountered in range-only SLAM. We provide a theoretical analysis of our method, including finite-sample error bounds. Finally, we demonstrate on a real-world robotic SLAM problem that our algorithm is not only theoretically justified, but works well in practice: in a comparison of multiple methods, the lowest errors come from a combination of our algorithm with batch optimization, but our method alone produces nearly as good a result at far lower computational cost.},

This new representation avoids the need of multiple hypotheses on the landmark positions implemented in most of the existing range-only SLAM algorithms. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the new range-only SLAM algorithm using the new state vector within the least squares framework.},

abstract = {— A mobile robot we have developed is equipped with sensors to measure range to landmarks and can simultaneously localize itself as well as locate the landmarks. This modality is useful in those cases where environmental conditions preclude measurement of bearing (typically done optically) to landmarks. Here we extend the paradigm to consider the case where the landmarks (nodes of a sensor network) are able to measure range to each other. We show how the two capabilities are complimentary in being able to achieve a map of the landmarks and to provide localization for the moving robot. We present recent results with experiments on a robot operating in a randomly arranged network of nodes that can communicate via radio and range to each other using sonar. We find that incorporation of inter-node measurements helps reduce drift in positioning as well as leads to faster convergence of the map of the nodes. We find that addition of a mobile node makes the SLAM feasible in a sparsely connected network of nodes.},

These measurements do not depend on water quality and can be taken from long distances. This paper proposes two methods based on the Sum of Gaussian (SoG) filter, to solve the range-only localization problem for homing. The use of the SoG allows us to combine the benefits of both a Particle Filter (PF) and an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) approach in a single filter. An Active Localization (AL) method is applied to the SoG to autonomously choose the best waypoints for autonomous convergence. Both the SoG filter and the AL are tested in a real scenario with an Intervention Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (I-AUV) and compared with a vision-based method to confirm localization.},

In this paper we propose a variation of the MH algorithm based on group moves, where the next state is obtained by first choosing a random transformation of the state space and then applying this transformation to the current state. This adds much-needed flexibility to the "textbook" MH algorithm where all measures involved must be given in terms of densities with respect to a common reference measure. Under mild conditions, our main result extends the acceptance probability formula of the textbook algorithm to MH algorithms with group moves. We work out how the new algorithms can be used to exploit a problem's natural symmetries and apply the technique to the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem, obtaining the first fully rigorous justification of a previous MCMC-based SLAM method. New experimental results comparing our method to existing state-of-the-art specialized methods on a standard range-only SLAM benchmark problem validate the strength of the approach.},

abstract = {This paper presents a solution to the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem of an AUV which uses range-only measurements towards a single beacon. It simultaneously estimates the beacon (a priori unknown) and AUV (a priori known) positions. Conventional EKF-SLAM methods cannot deal with this problem since the resultant probability density function (pdf) of the beacon-position is severely non-Gaussian during the initialization. Particle filters can do the job but, depending on the size of the space where the beacon lays, a significant number of particles may be required to populate the solution domain, making difficult to achieve real-time performance. In this paper we present a filter which represents the joint pdf of the robot and beacon positions as a Multivariate Gaussian Mixture which has the potential to represent an arbitrary pdf with a number of Gaussian 'particles' significantly smaller than the one that would be necessary if conventional particles were used instead. In our method, each particle contains a full EKF over vehicle position/velocity and the beacon position. The method is applied to locate a sub-sea panel and home to it autonomously in order to establish visual contact to later launch a visual servoing based docking task. The method is demonstrated through real-time Hardware-in-the-loop experiments (HIL) where the robot follows an observable trajectory.},

Recent advances in radio frequency technology make it possible to measure range between inexpensive beacons and a transponder Such a method has tremendous benefit since line of sight is not required between the beacons and the transponder and because the data association problem can be completely avoided. If the positions of the beacons are known, measurements from multiple beacons can be combined using probability grids to provide an accurate estimate of robot location. This estimate can be improved by using Monte Carlo techniques and Kalman filters to incorporate odometry data. Similar methods can be used to solve the simultaneous localization and mapping problem (SLAM) when beacon locations are uncertain. Experimental results are presented for robot localization.

As RF beacons provide only range information, recovering their positions is not an easy task. For this range-only SLAM case, a new procedure to instantiate the beacons in the filter is proposed. The method uses two range measurements from different robot's positions to initialize two hypotheses for the beacon's location, which are then integrated in the filter as a Gaussian mixture. This approach is evaluated and compared to other initialization techniques in simulation and with a real dataset.

However, it does not provide any means of differentiated services to improve the quality of service (QoS) for time-critical and delay-sensitive events. Furthermore, adaptive throughput performance for individual nodes cannot be supported with the current specifications. In this survey paper, we first discuss the negative aspects of IEEE 802.15.4 MAC in contention access period, contention-free period, and the overall cross-period, respectively, in terms of adaptive and real-time guarantees.

We perform an experiment in which a mobile robot lo- calizes using dead reckoning and range measurements to stationary radio-frequency beacons in its environment, incorporating the range measurements into the position estimate wing a Kalman filter. This data set involves over 20,000 range readings to surveyed beacons while a robot moved continuously over a path for nearly 1 hour. Careful groundtruth accurate to a few centime- ters was wwrded during this motion. We show the im- provement of the robot's position estimate over dead reckoning even when the range readings are very noisy.

This paper proposes a Range-Only scheme based on Sparse Extended Information Filters (SEIF) that efficiently exploits their capabilities.

The proposed scheme naturally integrates robot-beacon and inter-beacon measurements, significantly improving map and also robot estimations.

As a result, it has lower error and lower computer requirements than traditional methods. This paper presents the scheme, evaluates and compares its performance in simulations and real experiments.},

The only assumptions are the availability of odometry and a range sensor able of identifying the different beacons. We propose exploiting the con-ditional independence between each beacon distribution within a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF) for maintaining independent Sum of Gaussians (SOGs) for each map element. It is shown then that a proper probabilistic observation model can be derived for online operation with no need for delayed initializations unlike other approaches. We provide a rigorous statistical comparison of this proposal with previous work of the authors where a Monte-Carlo approximation was employed instead for the conditional densities. As verified experimentally, this new proposal represents a significant improvement in accuracy, computation time, and robustness against outliers.},

abstract = {This paper presents the localization of a mobile robot while simultaneously mapping the position of the nodes of a Wireless Sensor Network using only range measurements. The robot can estimate the distance to nearby nodes of the Wireless Sensor Network by measuring the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of the received radio messages. The RSSI measure is very noisy, especially in an indoor environment due to interference and reflections of the radio signals. We adopted an Extended Kalman Filter SLAM algorithm to integrate RSSI measurements from the different nodes over time, while the robot moves in the environment. A simple pre-processing filter helps in reducing the RSSI variations due to interference and reflections. Successful experiments are reported in which an average localization error less than 1 m is obtained when the SLAM algorithm has no a priori knowledge on the wireless node positions, while a localization error less than 0.5 m can be achieved when the position of the node is initialized close to the their actual position. These results are obtained using a generic path loss model for the transmission channel. Moreover, no internode communication is necessary in the WSN. This can save energy and enables to apply the proposed system also to fully disconnected networks.},

UASNs and terrestrial WSNs have several common properties while there are several challenges particular to UASNs that are mostly due to acoustic communications, and inherent mobility. These challenges call for novel architectures and protocols to ensure successful operation of the UASN. Localization is one of the fundamental tasks for UASNs which is required for data tagging, node tracking, target detection, and it can be used for improving the performance of medium access and network protocols. Recently, various UASN architectures and a large number of localization techniques have been proposed. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these architectures and localization methods. To familiarize the reader with the UASNs and localization concepts, we start our paper by providing background information on localization, state-of-the-art oceanographic systems, and the challenges of underwater communications. We then present our detailed survey, followed by a discussion on the performance of the localization techniques and open research issues.},

Also, from a practical perspective, 80.15.4-based networks are usually deployed in the vicinity of other wireless networks that operate in the same ISM band. This means that 802.15.4 MAC should be ready to cope with interference from other networks. These facts have motivated efforts to devise improved IEEE 802.15.4 MAC protocols for WSNs.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Most existing RO-SLAM techniques consider beacons as passive devices disregarding the sensing, computational and communication capabilities with which they are actually endowed. SLAM is a resource-demanding task. Besides the technological constraints of the robot and beacons, many applications impose further resource consumption limitations. This paper presents a scalable distributed RO-SLAM scheme for resource-constrained operation. It is capable of exploiting robot-beacon cooperation in order to improve SLAM accuracy while meeting a given resource consumption bound expressed as the maximum number of measurements that are integrated in SLAM per iteration. The proposed scheme combines a Sparse Extended Information Filter (SEIF) SLAM method, in which each beacon gathers and integrates robot-beacon and inter-beacon measurements, and a distributed information-driven measurement allocation tool that dynamically selects the measurements that are integrated in SLAM, balancing uncertainty improvement and resource consumption. The scheme adopts a robot-beacon distributed approach in which each beacon participates in the selection, gathering and integration in SLAM of robot-beacon and inter-beacon measurements, resulting in significant estimation accuracies, resource-consumption efficiency and scalability.

abstract = {In 15, Montemerlo et al. proposed an algorithm called FastSLAM as an efficient and robust solution to the simultaneous localization and mapping problem. This paper describes a modified version of FastSLAM that overcomes important deficiencies of the original algorithm. We prove convergence of this new algorithm for linear SLAM problems and provide real-world experimental results that illustrate an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy over the original FastSLAM algorithm. 1},

@inproceedings{Engelson1992,
abstract = {An issue that must be addressed in map-learning systems is that of error accumulation. The primary emphasis in the literature has been on reducing errors entering the map. The authors suggest that this methodology must reach a point of diminishing returns, and hence focus on explicit error detection and correction. By identifying the possible types of mapping errors, structural constraints can be exploited to detect and diagnose mapping errors. Such robust mapping requires little overhead beyond that needed for nonrobust mapping. A mapping system was implemented based on those ideas. Extensive testing in simulation demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed error-correction strategies},

@article{Li2015,
abstract = {Two decades ago, with the publication of [1], we witnessed the rebirth of particle filtering (PF) as a methodology for sequential signal processing. Since then, PF has become very popular because of its ability to process observations represented by nonlinear state-space models where the noises of the model can be non-Gaussian. This methodology has been adopted in various fields, including finance, geophysical systems, wireless communications, control, navigation and tracking, and robotics [2]. The popularity of PF has also spurred the publication of several review articles [2]?[6].},

@article{Thrun2002a,
abstract = {In recent years, particle filters have solved several hard perceptual problems in robotics. Early successes of particle filters were limited to low-dimensional estimation problems, such as the problem of robot localization in environments with known maps. More recently, researchers have begun exploiting structural properties of robotic domains that have led to successful particle filter applications in spaces with as many as 100,000 dimensions. The fact that every model--no mater how detailed--fails to capture the full complexity of even the most simple robotic environments has lead to specific tricks and techniques essential for the success of particle filters in robotic domains. This article surveys some of these recent innovations, and provides pointers to in-depth articles on the use of particle filters in robotics.},

@inproceedings{Blanco2008b,
abstract = {Range-only SLAM (RO-SLAM) represents a difficult problem due to the inherent ambiguity of localizing either the robot or the beacons from distance measurements only. Most previous approaches to this problem employ non-probabilistic batch optimizations or delay the initialization of new beacons within a probabilistic filter until a good estimate is available. The contribution of this work is the formulation of RO-SLAM as an online Bayesian estimation process based on a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter. The conditional distribution for each beacon is initialized using an additional particle filter which, eventually, is transformed into an extended Kalman filter when the uncertainty becomes sufficiently small. This approach allows the introduction of new beacons without either delay or any special non-probabilistic processing. We validate our proposal with experiments for both simulated and real datasets.},

The method is applied to autonomously locate a subsea panel and home to it in order to establish visual contact to later launch a visual servoing based docking task. The method is demonstrated through field experiments in a harbor environment with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) including Ultra-Short Baseline (USBL) ground truth information.},
